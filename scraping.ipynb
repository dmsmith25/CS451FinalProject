       " 'I made a mistake. I first heard about the Corrigan rumor from someone who read it here.  So it is June and I thought this would be a good time to explain my views on the Schiel v Bedford issue. (And Schiel v Rhoten in the process)  \\xa0 You never get a second chance to make a first impression. \\xa0 \\xa0I remember in the season of 2001-2002 I had to miss a couple of games.During the course of the season I asked 3/4 people for their take on the Amherst Men\\'s team. Two of these people saw Amherst play away. None of the games reported on were close so it is probable that close attention was not paid throughout.  \\xa0Anyway all conversations were practically the same and they went like this.  \\xa0\\'What did you think of the Amherst team\\'?  \\xa0\\'Pretty good\\'  \\xa0 \\'What did you think of Zieja?\\'  \\xa0\\'Which one was Zieja? Was he the guy with the \\xa0Brown hair who brought the ball up?  \\xa0 \\'No. What did you think of Harper?\\'  \\xa0 \\xa0\\'I\\'m not sure. Which one was he?\\'  \\xa0 \\xa0\\'Did anyone catch your eye?\\'  \\xa0 \\xa0\"Yes sir. That tall Frosh, the one with the REALLY NICE LOOKING shot. Blonde hair, Schiel. He is really good. How did Amherst get him?\\' etc. etc. etc.  \\xa0I then looked up the games that had been reported on and Schiel would have gone something like 1-3 or 1-4 and played maybe 12 minutes but some people have it and some people don\\'t. All most people had to see was Schiel launching one of his early in the game 3 pointers from way out, with beautiful form, nice arc, etc. and they were hooked. In D3 someone that tall who can shoot like he can is admittedly memorable.  \\xa0Then in subsequent years their initial impression never really went away. If he had a so/so game the next time they saw him, well anyone can have a bad game and the adoration did not lessen. If one saw every (Home) game last year and was able to be objective and forget about the really nice visual, then their inescapable conclusion is that Bedford was the MVP. Rhoten?? Well people who voted for POY were obviously NOT! capable of putting that very favorable impression in it\\'s proper perspective.  \\xa0 This does not mean Schiel will not be missed. He was one of the very few best players in the league and based on what I saw at the end of the season, it may be impossible to replace him. We will see.Hopefully someone can step Wayyy up.\\n',\n",
       " \"Andrew will be missed.His blend of power and skill will be tough to replace. That's the fun part of coaching! I am sure Hixon will adjust and find the right combination for success. I think the underclassmen are talented, enthusiastic and eager to contribute to the strong Amherst tradition. Go Jeff! Play hard, play smart and play together.\\n\",\n",
       " \"To all those that are worried about Trinity. \\xa0There is no need to worry. \\xa0Yes, they will have the most talent, for the second year in a row I might add, but what they don't have is heart. \\xa0I saw that team play on multiple occasions last year and they are more concerned with individual numbers than winning. \\xa0Every one of those guys was looking for their points and a way to stay out of foul trouble. \\xa0I know Rhoten is a good offensive player, but he doesn't play ANY defense. \\xa0I saw him give up layup after layup last year because he didn't want to foul or play tough inside. \\xa0Until they prove they have the some heart, I wouldn't worry about them. \\xa0Oh, and they were completely mis-managed by Ogrodnik last year. \\xa0  Is this a little harsh? \\xa0Yes, but I'm an alum so my $120K bought me that right.\\n\",\n",

Not being too close to the source of whatever info there is, I didn't get the player's name. All I heard was, that at the camp Amherst \\xa0has \\xa0during the summer some guard who was going to Amherst looked pretty good. I never got the name until later.(Olson)  This year sounds better. This came to me third or maybe fourth hand so like last year I do not know any names, except Baskauskas and it is not him I am talking about. Anyway the player will be coming to Amherst this Fall and I was told and he will be VERY!! good. The person who told me about him said for New England D3 you could call him \\xa0one of the best, RIGHT NOW!! He is supposedly about 6:5 and really jumps and can run and rebound and well we will see I suppose.This is one story I hope is true and accurate.  I heard some of the other newcomers looked pretty good also. The person who inititated these comments that reached me also said they liked the kid from California a lot.(I assume that is Baskauskas)  I hope this is accurate-The person who told me about these players did not actually see any of them play. It's just that i figured this was better than no news even if it is incomplete and turns out ot be wrong.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Let this be the biggest preseason news of the NESCAC season....this is from a very reliable source, Wes fans should be devastated as of what I have heard dominant big man (prob would have been the best center in the league this year) is out for the season due to academic reasons. \\xa0As of what I know, he will be back for next year (2006-07) to finish his schooling and bball eligibility, but is out for the entire year in 2005-06. What a shock for the Cards!! I thought they might be a top 4 team, maybe a possible contender with Kelly and guard Ashe leading the way. It gets worse though. I also have heard from a less reliable source that Ashe, who sprained his ankle against Amherst or Trinity, not sure which one, actually did more damge than originally believed. He only missed 3 or 4 games and came back for the last few last season, and he did actually look very good in the playoff game against trinity last season, though he had a very large brace on. Anyways, supposedly he ruptured a ligament in his high ankle and is having or already had surgery. He might be out for both his soccer and bball seasons!! is going to be tough to see these Cards finish higher than 7 or 8, maybe even slip out of the playoffs. Ashe is a great guard, one of the most explosive in the NESCAC, i saw him drop 20 on the Lord Jeffs at Lefrak and score 15 against Williams when they came back to beat Williams at home. He is aruguably the best two sport (soccer)athlete in the NESCAC, so if he is gone as well as Kelly, it is DEEP trouble for the Cards. They will have solid guards and a couple good sophs after decent freshmen seasons. But, if they lost just one of those two guys, as Kelly averaged 16 ppg and 10 boards while Ashe had like 11and was among league leaders in steals and assists, \\xa0even Conn Coll and Middlebury will beat them this year. Still, if Kelly and Ashe are back for 06-07, maybe it will work out in the end. WESCARDS04, other wes fans, if ur out there let me know if u know any of this or something more??\\n',\n",
       " 'Well, got some more info. Rob Kelly, going to be a senior, is definitely ineligible. He is only going to be back in 06-07, if allowed to reenroll at school. Jerod Ashe, only a Junior, and his injury is not for sure. Just what I had heard. They would be SOLID if both are there in O6-07, but who knows. Too bad for wesleyan bball after a surprisingly decent year.\\n',\n",
       " \"Best two sport athlete in the NESCAC is Mike Blair from Trinity. \\xa0All-Nescac in football, 3 time All-America in wrestling. \\xa0No contest. \\xa0No offense to Ashe, but he wouldn't have been top 3 two sport athletes at Trinity. \\xa0Aaron Goldstein (football, baseball, and 1 basketball season) and Jeff Natale (hockey and baseball) are ahead of him as well.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Halas,  Well take a step back. I will definitely give you Mike Blair as being the best, I actually forgot to mention him, wrestling can often stay under the radar. And Goldstein actually probably as good as Blair as well this year. Saw Goldstein in football, but not baseball. He was good. But does Natale even play hockey still? I saw a trinity NCAA hockey game, i dont think he was even out there?? Let me know, but i think natale only plays one sport, so i think u were a little off there. Anyways, it is an interesting argument but I was thinking in terms of guys that are still going to be playing next year, not already done with their careers so sorry to not have clarified that...For guys coming back to the NESCAC next year, no graduates, Ash would be my pick along with Dana Leary from Williams as the top two sports athletes in the conf. And Jeff Will, you are certainly right about Rhoten and his decision on not playing football. What a scary athlete he is!!!! Do you know why he decided not to try both??

       " 'Too close to call. I think each player brings a different set of problems. Bedford has tremendous teammates and has not had to score as much as Rhoten. Therefore, Rhoten looks more impressive to some people. I think Bedford would have similar numbers if he played for Trinity. \\n',\n",
       " \"I'm not so sure if I agree with you saying Tyler hasn't had good teammates as well.\\xa0 And I think Amherst's system fits Bedford better than Trinity's would, which gives Bedford more opportunities to post up smaller guards, basket cut from the weak side, etc.\\xa0 Amherst's lack of a huge post presence offensively gives Bedford more room to work.\\xa0 Trinity has had some very big bodies recently which may have prohibited Bedford from getting the ball exactly where he wants.\\xa0 The what if question is always a good one though.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Tyler HAS had some very good teammates. They have been very good for the past 2 years I have followed the NESCAC. I just think that Bedford is surrounded with better offensive players. Therefore he will get less shot than if he played at Trinity. Tyler took 18 shot a game last year. John took 10-11 shots a game. The both played approx. 30 min per game. I agree that John scores a lot on post ups but he is still an outstanding outside shooter. Also I think there are two different offensive philosophies employed by the respective programs.\\n',\n",

       " 'Speaking from an offensive point of view, I think that Amherst had better offensive players at all other positions (with the exception of Rhoten). Sometimes offensive execution is a function of the players on the floor. The defense is unable to take away all of the options.I am not sure Bedford will be taken more this year. It may go up by 1-2 but I would be surprised if it went up more than that. I also think that Amherst will have plenty of firepower to contend in the NESCAC.\\xa0 I think the entire con. will be competitive again. Trinity will be tough IF they get a viable second option. Being from Jersey, I know that the younger Rhoten is a good player, but I am not sure how much he will contribute this year.\\n',\n",
       " \"No way that Casnocha and Lee were better scorers than Taylor and Halas.\\xa0 I know Trinity will have a few new options in their lineup.\\xa0 If they can stay healthy, they will be very good.\\xa0 But if they are hurt, like last year, we all know what can happen.\\xa0 Clay is a very good player, but he's not the only newcomer that has the ability to make an immediate impact.\\xa0 Does anyone else ever look at this, or is it just us?\\n\",\n",

       " \"Surprised by the plentiful early season talk of the usually under the radar maine teams. All three suffered significant losses, (McGowan, Lindsley, Gerrity, Yakavonis), yet expectations appear to have grown exponentially. None of the the three have achieved a NCAA invitation in 7 seasons (Bowdoin '99). All three have terrible road conference records over this time. None have what you would call an upperclassmen dominated backcourt to win league games down th stretch on the road. Their may be talent in the north country, but it could be a touch early to annoin any of the programs top 4 in the league this season.Major questions1. How will bowdoin rebound and defend in the post? Petrie is not a physical presence, and who will play the post and defend skilled and top level front courts like Amherst, trinity, and Tufts.2. How will Bates replace Gerrity? There is a history of second half drop offs in wins and production from what I've seen in this program.3. Who scores after cohen for Colby? Jenkins and often injured Cohen? Who handles the ball for this team? How will they deal with pressure in backcourt? Athletic disadvantages??Some things to think about in regards to the Maine love affair.....\\n\",\n",
       " 'Slow my roll, as a matta fact im going to get my roll on, similar to the big tymers...Listen up, Yakavonis was a good player, great rebounder and defender, but claiming he was Bowdoin best player is misplaced argument. Everyone in the Nescac knows that Petrie is the Polar Bears\\' best player and arguably the second best player in the league. And I guarntee that the streaking Bobcats will not sweep the Trinity/Amherst roadtrip, be real with yourself...To the profound, all insightful \"Maineball\", what are you talking about (with all due respect). You believe Tufts have a top level frontcourt without Stovall, I would argue that their frontcourt is severly depleted, as is their team. Amherst\\'s frontcourt is same situation, Schiel is gone. And their best \"big\" player is Cashnoca and he runs away from the paint like he failed outta art school, come on...Im not arguing for Bates by any means, but how could you possibly predict the top four teams in the conference without Bowdoin or Bates, please check your references, since you seem to be the Nescac scholarAnd as for my boys in Brunswick, there are the only team in league to be returning all three backcourt players, thus your sentiments about not having a \"upperclassmen dominated backcourt\" is invalid, and besides Petrie is a senior and Bradley is a junior, in my book those are upperclassmenCant wait to hear yall responses...\\n',\n",

Coulibaly looks amazing as expected, he can shoot, drive, rebound, the whole nine yards. Baskauskas was very underwhelming, but to be fair, by the time he got on the court pretty much everyone on the court was clearly playing with complete disinterest. The one frosh who I thought looked really good was Marcus Bradley who had 8 points in 12 minutes, although he did turn the ball over three times. It looks like both Glen Wong and Bradley will play the point, which means that when Corrigan comes back the Jeffs will have an absurd five point guards, three of whom are sophomores or younger. I liked how Wheeler and O'Shea looked. O'Shea looks a lot bigger, and hopefully he and Hopkins will provide some physicality down low that was sorely lacking last year. Wheeler immediately looked to take an active role in the offense, I thought one of his biggest problems last year was a tendency to be a little hesitant.

There is no doubt that Rhoten is a dominant player in NESCAC, but much like Petrie, he tries to do too much on his own.

       " 'Senator Frost,You are right about the Amherst Endicott game (although it was only really the first half that was poor...Amherst won the second half 46-32...Amherst scored a dismal 22 points in the first half which I predict will be their season low for any half). Unfortunately for the rest of NESCAC, that is why Amherst plays Fitchburg and Endicott the first two games instead of Williams and Trinity. The team needs a game or two (or a half) to find their rhythm. For the third ranked team in the country that is not too long of a \\'coming together period\\'.As for sophomores and juniors coming around. Having a bench player come into a \"key game\" and score 9, grab 8 boards, play good D and not turn the ball over is a lot to ask. I think when a team tries to find their best four or five off the bench, they look for a group of interchangable guys who can score, rebound, play D and protect the ball, but knowing that they are not going to be at AS HIGH of a level as the 5 starters for that team. (There are very rare instances where that is incorrect, like Amherst 2 years ago with bedford coming off the bench.) But if you look at the Amherst game against Endicott, McLaughlin came in and scored 10, 1 rebound, 1 steal and no turnovers and Goldsmith got 9 rebounds in 15 minutes. Those numbers are not jaw dropping, but they are what Amherst is looking for to give starters a breather and continue to play good hoop.If a player comes off the bench and has 12pts, 8 reb, 2 assists, a steal and no turnovers in 15 minutes, he is like a 6th starter. 6 starters would be quite a commodity. Look at teams like Wesleyan, they don\\'t even have 5 starters.I think Friday\\'s game against Springfield (Derek Yvonne) will be a good test for Amherst despite SC\\'s record. A thing that should be noted that won\\'t show up in the box score will be defense on Yvonne by bench players of Amherst.\\n',\n",

(anybody see that Duke-Drexel game?) I'm excited to see Wheeler step into the role of a scorer and also play big on the boards. Last year we got killed on the boards in a lot of big games (Rochester), and I think that starting O'Shea/Hopkins Wheeler, Casnocha as the front three with Bedford playing the two will help solve that problem. I was impressed with how well the Jeffs were able to put the clamps down on Marinkovic, the impressive Serbian interior player for Endicott. He didn't score in the second half. I was disappointed that Coulibaly didn't contribute more, only scoring one point. I think we are seeing some large similarities between Trinity and Amherst, with last year's sixth man (Clarke, Wheeler), stepping up into a bigger role in the offense while the Div. I transfers (Martin, Coulibaly) take a few games to get into the groove with a new squad. Senator- I think anytime a team runs the conference schedule and postseason tournament they deserve to be considered the prohibitive favorites. Sure Amherst struggled against Endicott, but until a team from the NESCAC succeeds in beating them, Amherst is still the class of the NESCAC. I think the Jeffs eventually will be seven deep with solid players with Coulibaly and either O'Shea or Hopkins coming off the bench. Those are all guys can contribute significantly when they come into a game, even against a Trinity or a Williams. Looking forward to Friday's game against Derek Yvonne and Springfield.

At first I thought they would be truly horrific, with only one senior, not much height, and no pure shooters. However, the freshmen and sophomore class is not all that bad, led by the starting point guard Ben Rudin. If anyone watched the tornado that was Simon Behan who ran point for Midd the past 4 years, you'd undestand how many times he absolutely blew games for us. However, with a legit point guard, Midd is now 5-0 and has some momentum going into break. Another freshmen hit a 3 with 8 seconds to go to put us up 4 and seal the game. Though we don't have much height, we do have a number of 6'5 guys who can play down low and evan thompson's has some hops and had two unbelievable blocks in today's game.  Our biggest weakness is we lack a player who can take it from the perimeter and drive to the hoop and i think we'll run into some trouble against some good defenses, but so far i'm just impressed to see we're 5-0. Last year, we would have lost the union game, because we could never win a close game. But maybe this year is diff. Interested to see how Williams does against union. To stop them all you gotta do is stop John Caginello. The guy is absolutely lights out. Averaging 29 points a game for union and is clutch out of his mind from the free throw line. \\n\",\n",

His play just looked totally uninspired. Andrew Olson on the other hand single handedly put the Jeffs on his back and dragged them to victory. His only fault was not playing great defense against Pizzo, the speedy Springfield point guard who ran a great fast break. The difference in the first and second halves for Amherst in my opinon was mostly ball movement and half-court D. In the first half the Jeffs were passing crisply and kept finding open shots. Also, the did a great job of denying entry passes to Springfield, who had a hard time finding open shots outside. In the second half however, Springfield was able to get the ball down low without any issues. Something for the Jeffs to work on. \\n',\n",

The good news is that they can score points in bunches this year, something they almost never did last year. They have 4 very good 3 point shooters. Newton can score a lot of points as well, but he is still not all the way back from his injury. He needs a few more games to smooth things out. Our defense isn't very good, so we've got to score a lot to win. Rose is a star in the making, and Shalvoy has been light years ahead of last year. Nelson is a pleasant surprise this year. Our depth is not obvious at this point, though it is clear that Snyder (freshman) is a player, and will get better as the season moves along. The seniors Kuntz and Gibbon (along with Newton) need to be consistently good for the Ephs to outperform expectations. I expect there will be a number of bumps in the road because of the lack of depth, and the overall youth of the team. It appears to me that the NESCAC is a little better than last year form top to bottom, with the exception of Wesleyan. Based only on the game with Williams they are way down.

Speaking of depth, seems like Amherst may be playing a little TOO deep this year.\\xa0 Hixon is consistently giving 10-11 guys lots of minutes, which, I would think, might cause some continuity problems.\\xa0 But, then again, when their 10th guy is a Division I transfer, kind of hard to keep him on the bench.\\xa0 Go Ephs!\\n\",\n",

I don\\'t know much about Tufts, but I have heard several times no that their defense is suspect to say the least.\\xa0 Williams had no trouble knocking down the threes in Lewiston when they got open, and I think it\\'s safe to say they probably got open far more often against the weaker Tufts defense then they did against the stronger Bates defense.\\xa0 Williams didn\\'t lose yesterday so much as Bates won.

Best record among tying teams, against one another (head-to-head).2. Most conference wins (in games that are part of the conference schedule and count toward league standings).3. Comparison of results of conference games played against top 4 teams (including all teams at the 4th spot).4. Comparison of results of conference games played against top 8 teams (including all teams at the 8th spot).5. Comparison of results of conference games played against conference teams in rank order. Comparisons shall bemade one team at a time starting with the highest ranked team.6. If the tie remains after comparing results against the highest ranked team, the results against the next team in rankorder shall be used. This process is continued until a winner is determined.7. Coin flip (or similar random action involving all tied teams).If \"Comparison of results\" means whether a team won or lost then it appears then Amhert, Bates, and Trinity would be destined for a \"random action involving all tied teams\" to break their tie.\\xa0 This would likely be drawing out of a hat.\\xa0 (Hey, I didn\\'t say coin flip Cheers,Red1\\n',\n",

Red, just know that after painful losses to williams in the past 4 years, beating them by 28 is very satisfying.Nescac1,Appreciate the compliments of the hoop team. I saw Williams play Clark and they played well and shot the lights out. In the two Amherst games I saw, they didn\\'t get the same looks and didn\\'t win the battle of the boards. Rose is a good player but disappeared for stretches of yesterday\\'s game. The \"A-Town Stomp\" was a little over the top, but it was instigated by Williams setting the pregame scoreboard to the football score from the fall instead of 0-0. Both actions were disrespectful, but at least there was no physical damage or vandalism done to either school. No harm was done to the court or to anything other than egos. If there is another little big game this winter it will be interesting to see how the emotions play out off the court.\\n',\n",

It was as if it had been God's Will that the Ephs won. I began to sense that possibility when Jones broke his leg with 7 something left. Yet all you heard from the Eph fans was the greatness of the Lunch Pail trio and how Ephs had more heart, courage, etc. etc. No mention at all about the tremendous and stupendous amount of good fortune that shone down but was deflected from Amherst. The least I thought, that could have been done was a small acknowledgement Of Heaven sent good fortune or at least an acknowledgement of Frankie Four Leaf, the Ephs invaluable 6th man.\\xa0 \\xa0During the Nogelo years, especially the last 3, I always thought the Ephs had a better team. Last year folks from over the mountains were touting Amherst as a Superpower. Thus to listen to them, anything less than a final four would show Hixon was no good and/or the team had no heart. Well anyone who saw the game knows Rochester simply had a better, and DEEPER squad. I kept waiting to see Amherst show they were as good as Ephs painted them. I waited the whole season-Bottom line=Depth was simply not there.\\xa0 \\xa0Now this year there has been some razzing dished out as a result of Amherst sweeping Williams. I have yet to read anything that implied the Ephs lacked character, heart, guts, etc. I have yet to read anything negative about Paulson.Personally I think Paulsen is as good as they come when it comes to getting the most out of what he has.

Does luck play a role? Sure it does. Has luck been a primary factor in Williams' seccess over the last few years? It is always nice to have good luck, of course, but good players and good coaching are what makes the difference, not luck. Luck ebbs and flows, and at the end of the day usually evens out. The talent disparity between Williams and Amherst is very wide right now, and unless that narrows, no amout of good coaching and good luck is going to make any difference.

By the way, no one I know of has ever said anything negative about Hixon\\'s coaching ability, nor should they -- he is an outstanding coach and his team always plays hard, intense defense and the Jeff\\'s offense, particulary the last few years, has really run flawlessly and is incredibly difficult to guard.\\xa0 It was the inability to give credit where credit was due -- to the Ephs -- in the years Amherst fell short that always rubbed Eph fans the wrong way.\\xa0 \\xa0I don\\'t think anyone ever implied that the Amherst players had no heart, either.\\xa0 Guys like Harper, etc. had incredible fortitude.\\xa0 Some of the fans and some of the players been pretty cocky at times over the years, and I just think until they back it up in the big game, they should hold back a little.\\xa0 This year does seem to be different -- confident, but without the arrogant swagger that has been off-putting in the past.\\xa0 \\n',\n",

       " \"Going back to explaining how Williams was able to easily beat a Trinity team that had beaten Amherst at home, I think the answer is simply that Trinity matches up much better against Amherst than Williams does. Amherst and Williams play similiar styles of basketball, both relying on outside shooting, efficient passing and a balanced attack. Right now, Amherst simply does all of those things better than Williams, and was thus able to beat them easily. A team like Trinity however, is great at attacking Amherst's weaknesses, most notably the Jeff's interior defense and rebounding. It seems like in every game the Jeffs lose, they are outrebounded handily and have at least one player score a bunch of points inside. (Hauben, Rhoten, that guy from Occidental) What I don't understand is how Williams (a team similar to Amherst) was able to handle Trinity so easily. Maybe you guys up in Williamstown could give us some pointers. Did you really triple-team Rhoten at times? If so, how did you contain Martin and Clarke? \\n\",\n",

Certain teams don\\'t get special treatment nor do certain coaches. Amherst, Williams and other NESCAC schools self-recruit based on the quality of the school. I do think that Williams/Paulsen has dropped the ball recruiting in the past two years, but the remedy for that situation should not be to lower admissions standards. That should not be the policy for Williams hoops or any football program trying to compete with Trinity. Right now Trinity gets the best football players looking at NESCAC schools because the recruits think \"hey, I can go to a good school and not lose more than 2 games in my four year career.\" No one wants to lose. The basketball recruits are coming to Amherst because they will win 90+ games in four years. Middlebury dominates all stick sports (Hockey/Lacrosse) and they\\'re not admitting student atheletes that don\\'t belong there.

       " '\\xa0Surprising that folks from Williams have trouble with the written word. I never said 96-97 and 98 were luck. I said straight out that I thought the Williams teams were better those years. 04 has been covered. In 03 a crippling hamstring injury slowed Fitzsimons. He had started the year looking better and quicker with the ball than he ever had-He was resigned to playing about 10 minutes less per game and was not as quick as when the season began. Zieja had something wrong the whole year. It seemed to get worse and in the las t game with Ephs (Lunch Pail) Coffin held him to four shots. I will be the first one to admit that Coffin did the best job on Zieja and if you folks want to believe that he held him to four shots because he was super-go right ahead. Of course being associated with a place like Williams you might want to take a look back at the other games where they faced each other. You will see that while Zieja could not score at will v Coffin but that he had many good games. Of course if believing that the gutty effort of Coffin was responsible for the four shots, and that Zieja was healthy is what makes you happy-Well then you go right on believing it.  You might also R-E-A-D what I Actually wrote. I talk about two years as being \"Heaven Sent\" If you don\\'t like to hear this version of happenings back then, you shouldn\\'t come on here and boast about how Amherst was dumped by the Old Ephs in every key game. Injuries are part of the game. I know that. One difference between me and the Eph fans is I have no problem or trouble saying that it appears that Amherst was maybe a little lucky last year in the final battle with Trinity. Meantime no one from Amherst has said anything negative about Trinity and their players or their coach. I will also add that there were plenty of Anti Hixon comments two years ago. Amherst players were questioned as to courage and character. I do remember that Harper was the one who was singled out as being \\'good\\' or words to that effect. You can call me revisionist or anti Eph or Chauffer Driven-doesn\\'t matter. I will always consider those two year 03 and 04 as Heaven Sent for Williams.\\n',\n",
       " '\\xa0Hopefully there will be no more negativity from anyone including myself. Anyway, I still think Amherst and Trinity will sweep. I have to think that the loss to the Ephs was just one of those down days and that Trinity will rebound.  As far as admissions are concerned keep in mind that a lot of times a school rejects a student athlete AFTER they know He/She is not coming. Thus a coach would not be technically lying if He/She said \"Yeah Amherst took him but admissions here didn\\'t like him. They rejected him and he scored 1380 and was top 5%. It\\'s really tough here\"\\n',\n",
       " 'I actually think the \\'Hixon might have extra pull in the admissions office\" might make sense, seeing as he was recently (either this year of the year before) named co-AD. (It is my understanding that this is a temporary situation.) He is also an Amherst grad and has been coaching here for a very long time. He most likely has a very good relationship with the folks down at the admissions office. The one other thing I would like to say before we can hopefully end this Amherst-Williams mudslinging which tends to pervade this forum from time to time, is that general attitude at Amherst towards the athletics program in general amongst nearly everyone but the coaches and players is very close to disdain. Amherst is simply not the athletics-crazy atmosphere that Williams is (for better or for worse), and because of that I think it is likely that the admissions people are getting more heat from Tony Marx and others to make as few academic exceptions as possible than they are from the coaching staff to do the opposite. And I personally know several recruited football players with SAT scores of over 1400.

Injuries are a part of the game and to say the Ephs were lucky might be true but that goes with the territory. Injuries happen in all sports. As far as the recruiting, I know for a fact that the Williams coaches only get two hitstips on athlete when talking to Admissions. So, if they have a third or fourth they want to get in and they do not meet the qualifications they will not get in. Also, the Williams game against Trinity. Why cant people say the Ephs played a good game. Yes Trinity may not have played there best but the Ephs deserve some credit. They played the best they played all year.

I do not have a problem admitting that as an Eph's fan but give the Eph's their due against Trinity. They played great regardless of what Trinity did.

       " '\\xa0My use of the term \"Lunch Pail\" refers to a post I read about two years ago. In it, a Williams fan referred to Williams players as \"lunch Pail\" guys, guys who worked hard and showed up every day with no fancy stuff. Then either the same person or maybe another poster said that Amherst players arrived by Chauffered Limousine.Actually The Lunch Pail Post might be one of my two or three all time favorites, for as you can see I still refer to it today. I kind of saw the logic/imagery behind it.I don\\'t think it was an analogy because it seemed like \\'Lunch Pail\" was being used as an adjective- I mean a Lunch Pail does not do anything by itself. Interesting about Zieja-I didn\\'t notice anything until his Junior year and after that it appeared to get worse. Yes injuries are part of the game and my hope is that all personal stuff does not return. There is a difference between saying that Williams beat Amherst back when and then even naming the years, if one is so inclined. Saying that Amherst never won the big ones or something of that sort is where it STARTS to become personal.  As far as Bedford is concerned I think he could guard some of the point guards. As far as POY is concerned, if Rhoten gets it, so be it. The Amherst fans who appresciate good basketball know how lucky they have been, to have been able to see Bedford play as many times as they have.

That is very common for a team\\'s sixth man to get more minutes than one of the starters.You don\\'t make sense to me.

You go out and put in the best five who will help your team win.What I really think is going on is that someone at Williams made the username \"littlejeff08\" to try and cause some bickering between fellow Amherst fans. I could make a name \"ephfan09\" and talk about how Paulsen does the same thing (as proven through Snyder and Wall\\'s minutes), but that would be lame.Until you go out there and coach 20 winning seasons, 500+ wins, a final four and many NCAA appearences I don\\'t think you can criticize his coaching.Out of some of the best active coaches in D1 (Lute Olson, Beheim, K, Williams, Skinner, Donovan, Pitino, Cal, Calhoun, Bruiser haha) I am sure at least one of them in a questionable coach when it comes to personnell, but no one can criticize these guys because they are incredible coaches.

Not saying they can\\'t be beat if they don\\'t answer the bell mentally, but basketball wise they proved they\\'re far superior to anyone in the conference.2.) I definetly should not starting drinking at 2:30 in the afternoon.3.) Way too many people follow d3hoops.com for real information...for eaxample..During today\\'s Amherst senior night it was truly a great basketball environment. Hixon started all the seniors (who didn\\'t miss a beat by the way) and they dominated from the get-go. Corrigan had one of the best finishes to an and one I\\'ve seen in the past 3 years. Zalaski was like the Great Wall of China on defense, and Kaz was bombing 3\\'s like he was a reborn Craig Hodges, and Bedford was just dominate throughout.Unfortunately, league officials, administration...whoever, decided that they couldn\\'t let the senior enjoy their moment in the sun. First, a blatant chop block went uncalled at the end of the first half, nearly taking Corrigan\\'s career away from him, in an attempt to keep the game close. It seems that when games get out of hand, the refs decide they need to \\'balance the calls\\' and totally ignore the concept of impartiality...UNACCEPTABLE! Then, just when I thought the officiating couldn\\'t be worse, a Ryan McMullen look-a-like goes on a personal vendeatta against Keith \"Give me Ballz, Hixon!\" Zalaski. Talk about a tough Senior Night, Ballz gets called for an egregious travel after a hustle play resulted in a turnover. Then, he gets dotted with a 3 by a kid with a quaff. (Not really the refs fault, but still warrants mentioning). Finally, after showing signs of brilliance (if anyone thinks I\\'m exaggerating...send a request to Amherst\\'s AD for a copy of the game and watch the swooping lefty lay-in he drops on Tufts entire defense), the same McMullen impersonator bails out a Charles Barkley in the making with a foul call as the shot clock expired. Sadly, for everyone\\'s sake, Hixon had to take Ballz out of the game due to foul trouble and that was that for his Senior Night. Luckily, a certain Mike Salerno, who apparently is suffering from some type of fever, took over the reins and led the Lord Jeffs to victory...long and short of it...this guy\\'s pick for Final Four, then anythign can happen!\\n',\n",

I did post a lot last year, its been refreshing and productive at work(!) to avoid posting this year...I gave up fantasy sports too... but, Conn needs one simple positive post. Did any of you guys see Conn outplay Williams? I did. Rose is great and I knew his buzzer beating three would go down, but Conn outplayed Williams at Williams. That would have been 4 league wins. The Camels blew an 8-point second half lead to Colby...ok, we all blow leads, but the Camels could have easily had 5 league wins. Also, immediately following the Williams loss the Camels' two best players, Stone and Young, were suspended for four games, two of them league contests against Amherst and Trinity. Without Charles Stone, Conn played Trinity tight @ Trinity...the Amherst game was a blow-out with Casnocha shooting 4-4 from 3land from an avg of 26 feet away.The continued predictions that Amherst will beat Conn by 25 or 30 are misleading. One could argue that at their best Amherst is 20 points better than any team in the league. Thus, if Amherst plays well they may win by 20-30 pts.One thing is for sure, the days of Conn being an easy win are LONG GONE. The Camels will not be an 8-seed next year...they're already better than Colby and Bowdoin, they don't have one senior, and they're best players are sophs and frosh. Lastly, Charles Stone deserves 2nd team, along with Martin and Wheeler(underated) he's the best post-player in the league. Conn also has two ROY candidates in Billy Karis and Will Lyons...check the stats. Go Camels\\n\",\n",

Over the last two weekends (which have all been must win games for Amherst) he has been simply unconscious from the field. Amherst\\xa0 is so deep that when looking at potential All-Nescac selections you cannot simply look at stats. You have to realize that they sacrifice a few baskets a game in order to run through NESCAC opponents. I can confidently say that Rhoten would not average more than 15 a game IF he had the opportunity to play for the Jeffs. Also, Olson outplayed Ray this year and was huge in the first half at Williams when the rest of the team seemed to be a little tight. The way that Amherst has ended the season should guarantee them at least 3 players on the first and second teams. On another note, Tim McLaughlin should run away with the defensive player of the year award. If anyone has any doubt about his defensive abilities, check out his stats from the first half of the Bates game. Five blocks in a half....not bad for a backup guard.

Dan Martin and Russ Martin each got theirs as well.Amherst -21 Vs. Tufts tomorrow. Ajsnc13,As I said in my post, I didn't have time to check the Colby page. I was basing my estimate of Cohen's three point stats on the game he played here at Amherst. He took three 3pt shots that game and they all looked smooth and fluid and he hit 2 of them. How was I supposed to know that those are his only threes of the season? But you're probably right about me not being a serious poster...I posted the freaking All NESCAC All Crazy teams.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Two great games from LeFrak. Amherst vs. Bates- Stockwell and Ray both have great games, putting up 47 between them, 30 for Ray 17 for Stockwell to keep the Bobcats close for much of the game. Two weeks ago I said after seeing these two teams play that there was no way you could put Ray in the same category as Olson. After today, I'm changing my opinion. Ray is fast, can shoot and is a good passer and defender. He played with so much heart in the second half trying to keep Bates' season alive. In the end the story was the Bobcats inability to stop the Jeffs or hit three-point shots. I didnt see the final numbers, but after the first half Amherst was shooting a ridiculous 60% from the field. The Bobcats were something like 5 for 27 from downtown, and at least three of those made ones were Ray from well beyond the arc. I think with Ray and Stockwell returning, Bates could really make a run at the NESCAC next year. Trinity vs. Tufts- AMAZING basketball game. Tufts outhustles Trinity in the first half to pick up a 17 point lead, but could do nothing right for the vast majority of the second half, even with Rhoten sitting with foul trouble most of the time. Led by Michael Hoar and PAT MARTIN (outstanding-didnt know he could be this good) the Bantams charged back, it looked like tufts was a goner when Martin hit a three to put Trinity up by 6. For some unknown reason Sheldon refused to call a time out as the Jumbos were clearly imploding. After FINALLY calling a TO, the Jumbos regained their composure and Shepard led the Jumbos back. Trailing by two with 9 ticks left, Kumf misses BOTH free throws! The poor guy looked terrible on the Tufts bench afterwords, really felt bad for him...UNTIL after a missed free throw on the front end of a 1 and 1(forgot who missed) Shepard comes up with the ball and goes coast to coast for a layup to send the game into OT. From there on out, it was all Tufts, Pat Martin did all he could, but the Jumbos got to the line enough to get the win. Big story- the refs stunk in both of these games. I think the Bantams have a legitimate beef, Rhoten fouling out killed them. The refs called one touch foul after another and both teams were in the double penalty for a large portion of the second half. You would think in a game of this magnitude they would let them play.Hopefully Trinity will still get a bid. I know its a long shot, but I hope Rhoten's career isnt over. If so, he was an amazing player, the best in the NESCAC in each of the two years I've watched. (Apologies to Schiel)Both teams played with amazing determination. Amherst will have their hands full tomorrow.\\n\",\n",
